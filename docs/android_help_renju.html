<h2>Rules</h2>
<p>
  Gomoku Quest is Renju.<br />
  The main objective of the game is to place 5 stones in a row, but as black has a significant 
  advantage of playing first, black is not allowed to make 
  <ul>
    <li>Double three - two lines of threes (not blocked by white).</li>
    <li>Double four - two lines of fours.</li>
    <li>Overline - 6 or more black stones in a row.</li>
  </ul>
  In Gomoku Quest, you cannot play forbidden moves so you don't need to worry about inadvertently making illegal moves and lose. <br />
  If a game reaches 100th move and not mate, the game is declared a draw.
</p>

<h2>Random opening(for advanced players only)</h2>
<p>
  Unfortunately for advanced players, the rules stated above is not enough to erase black advantage. <br />
  So in Gomoku Quest, advanced players are given random balanced positions (a few moves played from the initial position) to start with.
</p>

<h2>Rating</h2>
<p>
  Although our rating system is equavalent to well known ELO rating system, your rating is usually displayed lower than your true rating, until you have played certain number of games (40 currently).<br />
  This is to avoid a player of true rating 1300 to start with 1500, so that his/her highest rating never gets updated, which we think is not motivational.<br />
  Therefore, it could sometimes be the case where your rating increases even if you lose a game (only on the surface, true rating always decreases if you lose).
</p>

<h2>Time control</h2>
<p>
  5-minute + 3-sec increment. <br />
</p>

<h2>Returning to game</h2>
<p>
  Even in case the app crashes, you can immediately return to the game if you re-invoke the app and press "Play".
</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>
  - Sometimes you might see your opponent's time rolls back, but that doesn't mean your opponent is cheating. It occurs when one or both of the players' communication is slow. Think of a situation like below.<br />
  [X plays a move in 1sec] => [Takes 2 seconds to notify the server] => [Takes 2 seconds to notify Y's client]<br />
  In this case, Y sees X thinking for 5 seconds but when the move arrives it turns out X has only spent 1 seconds and the clock rolls back.
