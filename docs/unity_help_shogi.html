<h2>Matching</h2>
<p>
  By clicking 'Play' you will be automatically matched to another player similar to your strength (as defined by rating).
</p>

<h2>Rating</h2>
<p>
  Although our rating system is equavalent to well known ELO rating system, your rating is usually displayed lower than your true rating, until you have played certain number of games (40 currently).<br />
  This is to avoid a player of true rating 1300 to start with 1500, so that his/her highest rating never gets updated, which we think is not motivational.<br />
  Therefore, it could sometimes be the case where your rating increases even if you lose a game (only on the surface, true rating always decreases if you lose).
</p>

<h2>Time control</h2>
<p>
  5-minute sudden death (no byo-yomi).
</p>

<h2>Returning to game</h2>
<p>
  Even in case the app crashes, you can immediately return to the game if you re-invoke the app and press "Play".
</p>

<h2>Password</h2>
<p>
  You need your password (displayed in the setting page) to re-login. We advise you to take a note of it.
</p>

<h2>Try rule</h2>
<p>
  In games where both kings enter opponents camp, it can often be near impossible to finish the game in a normal manner (i.e. One side mates the other) and the game can last forever.<br />
  We have adopted "try rule" proposed by a professional shogi player, which in our opinion addresses the issue in a simple and elegant manner.<br />
  In try rule, you are declared the winner immediately upon your king reaching the opponent's king's initial square (51 for Black, 59 for White).<br />
  We would like you to bear this rule in mind when you play Shogi Quest.
</p>

<h2>Tsuitate Shogi</h2>
<p>
  Tsuitate Shogi Online has been integrated into Shogi Quest! (v1.3 and later)<br />
  In tsuitate shogi (chess version of the game is called Kriegspiel), a game proceeds just as in a normal game of shogi, except that you can only see your own pieces.<br />
  Computer serves as an umpire (resides in the server) and tells you whenever either player made an illegal move or a check. <br />
  You lose immediately if you made 10 illegal moves. <br />
  Other than that a winner is decided according to normal shogi rules.
</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>
  - Sometimes you might see your opponent's time rolls back, but that doesn't mean your opponent is cheating. It occurs when one or both of the players' communication is slow. Think of a situation like below.<br />
  [X plays a move in 1sec] => [Takes 2 seconds to notify the server] => [Takes 2 seconds to notify Y's client]<br />
  In this case, Y sees X thinking for 5 seconds but when the move arrives it turns out X has only spent 1 seconds and the clock rolls back.
</p>

<h2>Other apps</h2>
<p>
  Our other android apps are listed <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=nase">here</a>. <br />
  All games can be played with your Shogi Quest account.
